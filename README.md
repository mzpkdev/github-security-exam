# GitHub Advanced Security Exam

## üìù Structure

- You will have to answer 70 questions, all of which will be multiple-choice questions.


- For some questions, there will be only one correct answer, while for others, there may be multiple correct answers.
  You will have 2 hours to complete the exam, which should be sufficient to answer all 70 questions.


- In terms of difficulty level, it is intermediate. meaning it is not so tough.  
  While some questions may be challenging, overall, it is not overly difficult.  
  **However, some questions may be confusing**, so it‚Äôs important to have a good understanding of the overall exam
  structure.
  With a solid grasp of the exam format, you should be well-prepared.
